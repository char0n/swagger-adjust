# Swagger Adjust

Swagger Adjust is a plugin-able framework for building [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) based applications.
This framework was born by the decoupling ideas of plugin-able core of [SwaggerUI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) into 
separate reusable component.

## General

Swagger Adjust allows you to build React + Redux applications in a way, where every component, being
it a React Component, Redux state slice composed of actions, selector, reducers or general business
logic is overridable and extensible.
